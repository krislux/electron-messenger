# Electron Facebook Messenger Wrapper

Facebook shut down their standalone Messenger app for desktop.
This was obviously done to push users toward using the full
Facebook experience instead, so they can make more money, because
it's extremely easy to get Messenger to work as a browser-app
just by going to https://www.messenger.com.

This wrapper simply lets you run this website in a webview inside
an Electron app, so you can have a standalone Messenger app again.

It's virtually indistinguishable from the original Messenger app,
making it even more obvious that Facebook's decision to shut it down
was deliberately anti-consumer.

Yes, this might be *the* simplest functional Electron app ever made.
